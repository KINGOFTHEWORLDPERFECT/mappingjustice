This document provides instructions to get the Mapping Justice application
configured for your machine.

This process has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

===============================================================================

Installing project dependencies:

Node.js
    To install node.js on Mac, run:
    $ brew install node

    To instal Nodejs on Linux, run:
    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    $ sudo apt install -y nodejs

npm
    Installing nodejs will also install npm. However, npm probably needs
    to be updated. To do so, run:
    $ npm install npm@latest -g

nginx
    To install nginx on Linux, run:
    $ sudo apt install -y nginx

MongoDB
    You can download the MongoDB database application from the following URL:
    https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?filter=enterprise&gclid=Cj0KEQiA08rBBRDUn4qproqwzYMBEiQAqpzns7UbS_M0a_zlxwHy3xECl9WveImnved6GC9cgtA7MgUaAkAm8P8HAQ#enterprise
    

===============================================================================

Configuring the environment:

a) Pull the required Javascripts:
$ npm install

b) Configure nginx (CURRENTLY LINUX ONLY, open the file to see what it does)
$ sudo ./config/webserver.sh

c) The application needs to be able to handle a server reboot. To do so, perform
the following steps:
    
    1) From a terminal window, run:
    $ crontab -e
    
    2) Add the following line to the bottom of the file which pops up:
    @reboot <PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/start_mapping_justice.sh
    , replacing <PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY> with the path to the project.

    3) Save and close the file.

d) Configure SSL.
    
    1) Install Let's Encrypt by running:
    $ sudo apt install -y letsencrypt
    
    2) To get your certificate, run:
    $ letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d map.atlantalegalaid.org
    
    3) Follow the same steps in Part C above to add the following line to the
    crontab file:
    34 7,19 * * * letsencrypt renew 
    Since the certificate will expire after 90 days, this ensures our cert is
    always up-to-date.

===============================================================================

Operating the application:

In the ideal case, the server runs at startup, so a "ps aux | grep npm" should
reveal if it's running.

Chances are, however, the server is not running. There are two ways to start 
the site. 

1) The first and simplest method is to run the automatic starter script. 
This is strongly recommended because it generates log files and sends processes
to the background. 

    From the project root directory, run the follwing command:
    $ ./start_mapping_justice.sh

2) The second method requires you to run two commands in two separate terminal windows.

    From the first terminal, navigate to <PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/bin and run 
    the following command:
    $ mongod --dbpath <PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/userdata/ --port 27017 --smallfiles

    From the second terminal, navigate to <PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY> and run
    the following command:
    $ npm start


You should be able to access the site by pointing your web browser to the 
following domain:
localhost

To view the map, visit the following URL:
localhost/map


===============================================================================

Debugging:

In the event you are unable to connect to "localhost", try connecting 
to "localhost:3000" instead
